Excel and Tableau using Wealth of Nations dataset

As part of the JustIT data bootcamp we have been assigned some projects to demonstrate our understanding of the applications and our abilities in exploring datasets using these applications.

For this project we used a dataset called 'The Wealth of Nations', which explores GDP, life expectancy and smartphone users for each country. We were given the task of exploring this dataset in excel, creating pivot tables and creating a tableau dashboard according to a brief using this dataset aswell.

We also had a look at some data policies and procedures, showing awareness of data protection policies and best practice.

This was great practice not only to help solidify my excel and tableau skills, but also learning to complete a project according to a brief.

Feel free to have a look over the attached project detailing my process for more information!
